## 3. Legal Bases for Processing
We rely on one or more of the following legal bases:

## 5. Data Retention
We retain account, property, and tenancy records for as long as you maintain an account or as needed to provide the Service. We may retain anonymised analytics data for longer periods. When you request deletion, we delete or anonymise your personal information unless retention is required by law.

## 6. Data Security
